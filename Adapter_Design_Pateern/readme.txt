The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. Essentially, 
the Adapter acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making it easier to integrate classes or
 libraries that otherwise could not work together due to differences in their interfaces.

Key Concepts of the Adapter Pattern

Adapter (or Wrapper): Converts the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects.

Client: The part of the application that uses the target interface.

Target Interface: The expected interface that the client works with.

Adaptee: The existing interface/class that needs to be adapted.


Real-World Example: 
Integrating a New Payment System
Imagine you’re developing an e-commerce application, and the current payment gateway uses a PaymentProcessor
 interface to process payments. Now, you want to integrate a third-party payment library that has a different 
 interface, ThirdPartyPayment, which doesn’t match PaymentProcessor.

Using the Adapter pattern, you can create an adapter class to convert ThirdPartyPayment to work with your
 existing PaymentProcessor interface.
